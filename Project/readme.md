### Executive Summary

During the final assignment, I will be researching the benifits of using a VPN. I will also be researching and learning about methods to avoid doxing attacks.

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

Describe the process you will take to become co-op ready (include dates of seminars you will plan if you elect Option 1 OR, a brief description of the project you plan to implement (programming, research etc.)

### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.

See Blackboard or OneNote (depending on your class) for details

### Conclusion

After this final assignment, I researched VPN and I have an overall better knowledge on how a VPN works and the benifits of using a vpn. I also have a better understanding of doxing attacks and the effects of doxing.
