## Executive Summary 


## Hardware
  The role of a CPU, or a central proccessing unit is responsible for carrying out the commands send to it by the software and returns results to be acted on. The CPU is also known as the brains of a device! The components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit or the ALU.
### Hard Drives and Memory
The hard drive is a device with internal moving parts, while SSD stores data in memory chips. SSD has greater stability over their disk counterparts.
Increasing the RAM on a computer makes it run faster because when the RAM is too low, some of the data is kept on the slower hard drives. Instead of data going from RAM to the CPU, it has to do more work by going to the slower hard drives therefore slowing down your computer.

DIMM transfers 64 bits at a time while SIMM transfers 32 bits of data at a time making SIMM faster than DIMM.
