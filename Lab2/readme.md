## Executive Summary 
   During this lab, I will learn about different hardware components. I will be able to explain the purpose of each and how they work together. I will also learn about binary numbers and converting into decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. I will be able to effectively present data representations. There are many different various hardware components that make up an infromational system. These include the CPU, keyboard, mouse, RAM, and more. The hardware takes input data from the user, stores it, then the data is displayed by the output.

## Hardware
  The role of a CPU, or a central proccessing unit is responsible for carrying out the commands send to it by the software and returns results to be acted on. The CPU is also known as the brains of a device! The components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit, the control unit, and the memory unit. The ALU is whats responsible for preforming mathematical operations. The control unit leads operations to the processor. The memory unit stores data and infromation.
### Hard Drives and Memory
The hard drive is a device with internal moving parts, while SSD stores data in memory chips. SSD has greater stability over their disk counterparts.



#### Latency and Transfer Rates
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
Increasing the RAM on a computer makes it run faster because when the RAM is too low, some of the data is kept on the slower hard drives. Instead of data going from RAM to the CPU, it has to do more work by going to the slower hard drives therefore slowing down your computer. The term 64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in one clock cycle. DIMM transfers 64 bits of data at a time while SIMM transfers 32 bits at a time making DIMM faster because they can transfer double the bits at one time.
### ALU and the Control Unit 
The control unit recieves a mathematical operation from RAM as an instruction then tells the ALU what operation to perform. The ALU then solves it and output the answer.

#### CPU, Input & Output 
In a supermakrket input, output, and cpu is used in multiple ways. The input cointains things like the keyboard behind a register, the credit card reader, and the scales build into the register. The output contains things like the cashiers monitors, automatic doors, speakers and more! The CPU carries out the instructions by performing the basic arithmetic logic which in a grocery store can be adding up the total amount of money for your groceries.
### Logic Gates 
A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic. The purpose of a truth table is to show the truth value for one or more compound. A truth table is relevant in computer processing because it shows the output you get for every possible input.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of IEEE is advance innovation and technological excellence to benifit humanity. Having ethics is very important in device design because it provides the consumer with clean and honest products. 
## Data Representation
Base-ten is decimal, Base-two is binary, base-sixteen is hexadecimal.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#abb0ff is going to be a pale blue color.
The color is going to be problamatic for some people who have a low vision impairment or a color deficiencies. An option fix it is to use larger fonts with dark backgrounds. Also avoiding picture bases text and using text whenever possible.
 ## Conclusion
     After the completion of this lab, I got a good understanding of different hardware components, data representation, and converting decimal, binary, and hexadecimal effectively and efficiently.
