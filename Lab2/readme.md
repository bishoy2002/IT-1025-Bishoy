## Executive Summary 


## Hardware
  The role of a CPU, or a central proccessing unit is responsible for carrying out the commands send to it by the software and returns results to be acted on. The CPU is also known as the brains of a device! The components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit or the ALU.
### Hard Drives and Memory
The hard drive is a device with internal moving parts, while SSD stores data in memory chips. SSD has greater stability over their disk counterparts.
Increasing the RAM on a computer makes it run faster because when the RAM is too low, some of the data is kept on the slower hard drives. Instead of data going from RAM to the CPU, it has to do more work by going to the slower hard drives therefore slowing down your computer.

DIMM transfers 64 bits at a time while SIMM transfers 32 bits of data at a time making SIMM faster than DIMM.
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
The Arithmetic logic unit or ALU is what preforms all the mathematical operations inside the CPU. ALU contains two inputs known as input A and input B. The control unit recieves mathematical operations from RAM then tells the ALU what to preform.
### CPU, Input & Output
In a supermakrket input, output, and cpu is used in multiple ways. The input cointains things like the keyboard behind a register, the credit card reader, and the scales build into the register. The output contains things like the cashiers monitors, automatic doors, speakers and more! The CPU carries out the instructions by performing the basic arithmetic logic which in a grocery store can be adding up the total amount of money for your groceries.
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Data Representation
Base-ten is decimal, Base-two is binary, base-sixteen is hexadecimal.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#abb0ff is going to be a pale blue color.
The color is going to be problamatic for some people who have a low vision impairment or a color deficiencies. An option fix it is to use larger fonts with dark backgrounds. Also avoiding picture bases text and using text whenever possible.
