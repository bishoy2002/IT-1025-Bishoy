## Python IDLE
Python shell is a command tool that starts up the python interpreter. It runs the python instructions one at a time. It is useful in letting you test the codes and get familiar with them. The file editor is the completely blank editor that is better for writing and running full program. It allows you to run the whole program all at once.
### Variable:
Variables are used to store data, they take up memory space according to the type of value we assign to them. The author used variable names spam, bacon and eggs to provide an example of a variable representing a word. An example of a variable is bacon = 100 which is giving the word bacon a value of 100. 
### Assignment statement:
A assignment statement places a value on a noun. An example of a assignment statement is X = 1000. It means that the value 1000 is being assigned to the variable, which in this example is X.
### Function:
A function in python is a block of code that preforms some tasks and that can be called by a specific name that the programmer chooses. To make a function, you would have to use the "def" code.
