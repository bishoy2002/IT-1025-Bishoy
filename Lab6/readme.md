## Executive Summary 
During this lab, I will be learning about the internet and the protocols that enable Internet communication. I will be learning more about data and the importance of a securing your browser. I will also be learning HTML and pracice on the w3schools website. I will also be creating a webpage with HTML and CSS.

## Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
IPv4 only allows 4 billion unique addresses, which is not enogh for every device on earth to have its own address. IPv6 replaces IPv4 32-bit address with a 128-bit address. 
#### IP Address
An IP address, short for Internet Protocol address, is a number that identifies network hardware that is connected to a network. An IP address enables a device to communicate with other devices over an IP-based network such as the internet.
#### ICANN
The ICANN is a non-profit organization comprised of people from all over the world committed to keeping the internet secure and stable. The ICANN contributes to the global internet by managing domain names and network addressess.
### TCP/IP

#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is, it specifies how devices exchange data over the internet to one another.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client-server model applies to TCP/IP exchanging data over the internet 
#### Layers
Layers play a crucial role in changing the internet. With the stacking process, you can make changes to the software and application without having to change the entire software or spplication. Protocol stacks interacts with the levels above and below it, therefore making any changes in the process possible.
#### Application Layer
The application layer runs utility applications. DNS (domain name system), RIP (routing information protocol), and DHCP are examples of utility applications.
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. HTTP is the worlds most widely used protocol for viewing web pages on the internet.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP. It makes sure that any data that is transfred on the internet between computers and servers is secure by making the data impossible to read. 
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
Securing your browser is an essential part of internet security and data protection. Securing your internet browser protects you against spyware being installed without your knowledge. By securing your internet browser, your protecting your data against data theft attacks and unauthorized access to your computer.
### Risk Explained
A risk that comes with using the internet is cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Cross-site scripting in a vulnerability in a website that allows an attacker to take advantage of the trust relationship you have with that site. This vulverability can cause a serious data theft and cybercrime risk.
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is a computer scientist that is best known for inventing the World Wide Web. He created W3C as a way to grow a community, and be able to provide great internet service and growth for world wide web.
### HTML5 and CSS
There is a lot that goes into creating a web page, and each technology aspect plays a key role. For creating my HTML web page, I practiced on the w3school website, then I created my webpage using TextEdit. After I was complete with an aspect of my webpage, such as changing the text color, I went to my files and opened the webpage using google chrome. The idea and the approach I took was creating an open social media platform.  
### HTML and XML
## Components of a URL
scheme- HTTPS
domain- www.amazon.com
Top level domain- .edu
parameters- no file path provided
anchor- specific language on a page
defult page- result of search
