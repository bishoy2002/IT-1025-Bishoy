## Lucidchart
Even though I originally had trouble at first using and creating a Lucidchard, I had a good experience. In the beginning I was very confused on how to set up lucid, because its my first time using it. I learned how to use it pretty quick and it seems like a very helpful tool that I will possibly be using in future classes. I was able to create the flowchart after I learned how to use it. Overall, my experience using lucid was positive, and it will be useful and benifitial in the future.
