## Lucidchart
Even though I originally had trouble at first using and creating a Lucidchard, I had a good experience. In the beginning I was very confused on how to set up lucid, because its my first time using it. I learned how to use it pretty quick and it seems like a very helpful tool that I will possibly be using in future classes. I was able to create the flowchart after I learned how to use it. Overall, my experience using lucid was positive, and it will be useful and benifitial in the future.
## Introduction to Networking
### Data Transmission

#### Packet:  
A packet is a unit of data transmitted over the internet. When a host intends to send a message to another host, its breaks down that message into smaller pieces called packets. Each indivitual packet has the senders address, the recievers address, a sequence number, and a piece of the message that is being send.
#### Packet-Switching:
Packet switching is the technology that allows packs of data to be routed based on destination address. When a message is being send over the internet, routers try to find an optimal route for each specific packet. This process can result in packets being sent on different routes to its destination. The packets are then reassembled into the original message for the recipient once they arrive.
#### IP Address:
An IP address is a unique identifying number. IP stands for "Internet Protocol". Every device on the internet is assigned a unique identifying number, called an IP address.
#### DNS:
DNS is a directory of IP address common names. DNS stands for domain name server or system. On the Internet, DNS serves as a directory of websites. A DNS server is queried when a request is made to access a host with a domain name. It returns the requested host's IP address, allowing proper routing.
#### Protocol:
Protocol is a set of rules to allow devices to communicate. Protocols specify how data should be formatted, transmitted, and received.
### Networking Hardware
The benefits of a switch over a hub, is a hub does not filter out any data or has any intelligence as to where the data is supposed to be sent. The only thing a hub knows is when a device is connected to one of its ports. While using a hub, every device connected to it can recieve data even though the data was meant for one of the devices. Unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent. A switch can learn the physical addresses of the devices that are connected to it, and it stores these physical addresses called MAC addresses, in its table.

Unlike hubs and switches, the benifit of using a router is its able to read IP addresses. By a router reading IP addresses, it will be able to exchange data outside of their own network. In conclusion, hubs and switches are used to create networks, while routers are used to create them.
