## Executive Summary 
During this lab, I will be introduced to lucidchart, and I will be creating a computer program that will be asking for a number and have it print big if the number is over 12, or small if the number given is under 12. I will also be learning about different data transmissions and and how they send and receive data. In addition, I will be learning about different network topologies. I will also be learning about cyber security and encryption.

## Lucidchart
Even though I originally had trouble at first using and creating a Lucidchard, I had a good experience. In the beginning I was very confused on how to set up lucid, because its my first time using it. I learned how to use it pretty quick and it seems like a very helpful tool that I will possibly be using in future classes. I was able to create the flowchart after I learned how to use it. Overall, my experience using lucid was positive, and it will be useful and benifitial in the future.
## Introduction to Networking
### Data Transmission

#### Packet:  
A packet is a unit of data transmitted over the internet. When a host intends to send a message to another host, its breaks down that message into smaller pieces called packets. Each indivitual packet has the senders address, the recievers address, a sequence number, and a piece of the message that is being send.
#### Packet-Switching:
Packet switching is the technology that allows packs of data to be routed based on destination address. When a message is being send over the internet, routers try to find an optimal route for each specific packet. This process can result in packets being sent on different routes to its destination. The packets are then reassembled into the original message for the recipient once they arrive.
#### IP Address:
An IP address is a unique identifying number. IP stands for "Internet Protocol". Every device on the internet is assigned a unique identifying number, called an IP address.
#### DNS:
DNS is a directory of IP address common names. DNS stands for domain name server or system. On the Internet, DNS serves as a directory of websites. A DNS server is queried when a request is made to access a host with a domain name. It returns the requested host's IP address, allowing proper routing.
#### Protocol:
Protocol is a set of rules to allow devices to communicate. Protocols specify how data should be formatted, transmitted, and received.
### Networking Hardware
The benefits of a switch over a hub, is a hub does not filter out any data or has any intelligence as to where the data is supposed to be sent. The only thing a hub knows is when a device is connected to one of its ports. While using a hub, every device connected to it can recieve data even though the data was meant for one of the devices. Unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent. A switch can learn the physical addresses of the devices that are connected to it, and it stores these physical addresses called MAC addresses, in its table.

Unlike hubs and switches, the benifit of using a router is its able to read IP addresses. By a router reading IP addresses, it will be able to exchange data outside of their own network. In conclusion, hubs and switches are used to create networks, while routers are used to create them. 
### Network Topologies
A single point of failure is when the central hub or switch fails, then all computers on that central point would be affected. A topology that is affected by a single point of failure is the star topology. Also the bus topoplogy is also affected by a single point of failure. In a bus topology, all workstations are linked to a single backbone. The entire network will go down if the backbone fails.

#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
Infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices. Wireless topology devices connect directly to each other without using a centralized device, such as a wifi or access point. I think that the wireless topology is better. The reason I think it's better is because with a wireless topology all the devices connect to each other without the need for a access point or router. This makes each device responsible for its own security. Also with a infrastructure topology, if the main router or access point fails, all the devices connected to it will also fail.
### Network Design
In my design, I have the router which is sendinding data to the wirless access point and the switch. The wireless access point is connected to the two computers through a wireless connection. The switch is connected to the printer through a wired connection.
### NSA/CSS
The NSA plays a major role in cybersecurity giving the U.S a combat support agency a strategic advantage over adversaries. America relies on the NSA to collect and process foreign signal. The share these signals to U.S officials and war fighters. The NSA has a very talented team that decodes signals into usable intelligence. The NSA is also counted on protect sensitive U.S government communications and information systems from hostile adversaries.
## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security;

#### Security Triad
Each component of the security triad would heavily impact my job and my sensitive infromation. The components of a security include: confidentiality, integrity, and availabilty. Confidentiality is very important to restrict my private information to only people who are authorized to view it. Integrity is the assurance that any information being accessed has not been altered and represents what is intended. This is very important for my job because it assures that any documents or records involving my job are not being altered. Availabilty is information that is available and can be altered by someone who has authority to do so in an appropriate timeframe.
#### Authentication
There are many daily tasks that require multi-factor authentication. The first daily activity that requires multi-step authentication is signing in my bank account. When I sign in my bank account, I provide a password. This could be a multi-factor authentication if it requires me to verify my password through my email. Using my debit card at a grocery store also requires multi-factor authentication. When I swipe my card, I have to enter my pin number. The third daily activity that requires authentication is signing into my email. The authentication is the email and password. This could be a multi-factor authentication, if i'm required to verify my email through my phone number.
#### ACL and RBAC
 The ACL stands for access control unit. The advantage of using an ACL is the fact that it is very easy to understand and maintain. The disadvantage of an ACL is that each information resource is managed independently, therefore it would be very difficult for a security administrator to add or remove a user from a large set of information resources. The RBAC is an improved and more efficient method of access control. RBAC assigns users to roles, and then those roles are given access. This allows administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administrators and, as a result, improving security. 
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
Ciphertext- A message after its been encrypted using an encryption protocol or algorithm.
Public key- The public key can be  used to encrypt the message, and can even be published online. 
private key- The private key can only encrypt messages and is private to only you.
#### Public Key Cryptography
Public key cryptography is an encryption method that uses two-part keys. They use private and public keys when a message is send. We need public key cryptography to ensure that sensitive data and information can only be accessed to the recipient thats authorized to view it.
### Cryptography
When I typed the phrase "cryptography is a growing field", and turned the wheel, it encrypted the message to "dszquphsbqiz jt b hspxjoh gifme". It encrypted the message by having every letter in the phrase the following letter. For example, the letter c got put as d, the letter r got put as s, the letter p got put as q, and so on.
#### Encryption

#### Frequency Fingerprint
When I typed my message, the results were completely random. Frequency fingerprint messages can be encrypted and wok with different languages other than just English.
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher is a encryption method that uses multiple substitution alphabets. 
#### Polyalphabetic Example
An example for polyalphabetic cipher is when I typed my message in the polyalphabetic encrypter on khan academy. The word I encripted is "hello". My result was "pjxxd". The reason I got my result, was because polyalphabetic cipher encryption uses multiple substitution for the alphabet.
#### Brute-Force
Brute-force is simply the calculation of the total distance for every possible route and finds the shortest one. Bru
