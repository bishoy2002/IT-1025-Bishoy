## Executive Summary 
During this lab, I will be using files and folders and I will practice compressing files and getting an overall knowledge with the properties of files. I will also be learning the impact of compressing files and the reasons to compress a file. I will also learn about object oriented programming (OOP).  In addition to learning about OOP, I will be  creating and diagramming software.


## File Compression

### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is a data compression method in which the size of a file is reduced to save disk space. File compression is useful when your sending files and to save data. 
### Compression and File Size
Before I compressed the svg, it was 336 KB. After I compressed it, the result was 144 KB. If I were to compress the JPEJ file, the size will not differ because the file is already compressed.
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes: 
The attribute is the name.
### Methods: 
The method is the function.
The method is the swim(), and the be awesome().
### Constructor: 
The constructor method is used to set data. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
### Class vs. Object
The class is a blueprint created by programmers for an object. It defines the set of attributes that will characterize the object. The object is the realized version of the class. To instantiate an object refers to taking the template or class and then create an object from the template.
## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
Sammy= shark ("sammy") and steve = shark ("steve") instantiated objects of the shark class.
### Inheritance
Inheritance related to OOP is the classes can have children which means one class can be created out of another class. The parent class is also known as base class while the child class is called derived class. In the shark class, for example, the parent is shark class and children classes will inherit all the attributes and behaviors of the shark class.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction and encapsulation are the overarching process that a programmer follows to describe a real life process. An example in the shark class, abstraction is the process that programmers utilize to describe a object into its attributes and methods to create the shark class.
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
After this lab, I have an overall knowledge on files and folders. I practiced compressing files and when is it useful to compress files or folders. I also have a better knowledge of OOP.
