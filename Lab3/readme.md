## Executive Summary 
During this lab, I will be exploring different types of software and the purpose of each.  

## Software
   Software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software can be divided into two categories: operating systems and application software. Operating systems manage the hardware and create inerface between the hardware and the user. Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, and/or browsing the web. An example of utility is a anti-virus software. An example of operating system software is windows or apple macOS.
   
### ERP
The purpose of a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is to bring together an entire organization within one program. An example of an ERP software is SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.
## Virtualization
  Vitualization is the process of using a software to simulate a computer or other physical devices.
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Vitualization can reduce electricity use and the cool time for physical servers therefore reducing costs. The hypervisor manages the virtualized servers.
### Option A: Compare and Contrast Virtualization (delete if selection option B)


## Python
   Python is a easy to learn programming language that allows programmers to code and create simple or complex programs.
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Psuedo-code nature of python allows you to concentrate on how to solve a problem, rather than the language itself.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is coded by a human then the code runs into assembly languages so that the program runs and returns a desired outcome. An interperted languae is compiled in a real time when its run and is more simple to use.
