## Executive Summary 
During this lab, I will be exploring different types of software and the purpose of each. I will be introduced to virtualization and the challenges that are solved by using vriualization. I will also be introduced to python and writing code using python. I will also be exploring different carre options that are available after getting my degree. 

## Software
   Software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software can be divided into two categories: operating systems and application software. Operating systems manage the hardware and create inerface between the hardware and the user. Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, and/or browsing the web. An example of utility is a anti-virus software. An example of operating system software is windows or apple macOS.
   
### ERP
The purpose of a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is to bring together an entire organization within one program. An example of an ERP software is SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.
## Virtualization
  Vitualization is the process of using a software to simulate a computer or other physical devices.
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Vitualization can reduce electricity use and the cool time for physical servers therefore reducing costs. The hypervisor manages the virtualized servers.
### Option A: Compare and Contrast Virtualization (delete if selection option B)


## Python
   Python is a easy to learn programming language that allows programmers to code and create simple or complex programs.
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Psuedo-code nature of python allows you to concentrate on how to solve a problem, rather than the language itself.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is coded by a human then the code runs into assembly languages so that the program runs and returns a desired outcome. An interperted languae is compiled in a real time when its run and is more simple to use.

I have found that the job growth for IT related fields is on the rise.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
 Careers in the IT field are on a steady rise faster than the average of other careers. Web Developers and Digital Designers make $73,760 per year and usually need an associates degree. For web developers and digital designers, there are 174,300 with a eight percent growth rate. Jobs related to the IT field are expected to grow with the rise of technology in day-to-day life. 
### Co-ops / Internships

### Industry Associations / Student Organizations

## Conclusion

During this lab, I build a better understanding of applications, operating system, and utility. I also was introduced to python and the importance of vitualization and the problems that it solves. I also explored careers in the IT field and infromation on those careers and seeing which ones im most passionate about.
