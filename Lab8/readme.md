## Executive Summary 
Durning this lab, I will be Describing various database models and practice SQL queries on a database (structured query language. I will also be identifying  key ethical and legal implications of information systems.

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data is defined as raw, unanalyzed, and unorganized material used to derive information after analysis. The set of data that has already been processed, analyzed, and structured in a meaningful way to become useful is referred to as information. The familiarity and awareness of a person, place, or event is referred to as knowledge.
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary key of customers is the foreign key of order.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
#### Foreign key of orders table: 
The foreign key in the orders table would be the customer's ID. 
### Field Data Types
The data type informs the database about the types of functions that can be performed on the data. Also it's important to define data to use a proper storaging amount.
### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
The caracteristics of big data are volume, variety, volocity, and variability. Volume is the size of the data, variety is the sources of data, velocity is the speed of the data, and variability is inconsistency of the data.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Business processes, application logs, network, social media sites, and mobile devices have increased need for big data.
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is an acronym that stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, also for all modern data bases.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys
When a child table &quot;orders table&quot; defines a Foreign Key column that references the Primary Key column of its parent table &quot;employees table&quot;, the relationship between them is executed. For example, the employeeID is a foreign key in the orders table that connects to the primary key employeeID in the employees table.
## SQL Injections
SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to circumvent application security measures.
## Ethical and Legal Implications

### Code of Ethics
The Code identifies the fundamental values that underpin the mission of social work..The Code is intended to inspire and guide all computing professionals in their ethical behavior.
### Intellectual Property
An Acceptable Use Policy is a contract entered into by two or more members of a computer network community, while the code of ethics is the values.
### Information Collection
The website of my choice is the curreptocurrency bitcoin website. The website collects information such as "log data".

## Conclusion
After this lab, I have a good understanding of various database models and I also practiced using SQL queries on a database. In addition, I also have a better understanding of legal and/or ethical implications regarding an information system.
