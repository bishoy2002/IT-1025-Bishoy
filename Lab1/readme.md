## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the setup for the IT1025 class and learn and get used to using GitHub to do my work in organized repositories. This class will cover a wide variety of topics from components of a infromation system, to cyber security. This course will cover topics that will assist me with my passion of IT. 

## Information System Components
Components of infromation systems are the hardware, software, data, people, and processors.  Each component plays a specific role!

## GitHub
GitHub allows users to create new ideas with organized and easy to use repositories.
### Client - Server Architecture
A client server allowed users to log in to the local network or LAN from their device by connecting to a centeral computer called a server.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the practice of storing data on a client hosted server, rather than on a personal device. Examples of cloud computing are social media platforms.

## Conclusion
During this lab, I learned how to use the GitHub platftform. Although i had trouble making my lab at first, i practiced and now i have a good understanding of how to use GitHub to do my assignments. I read chapter one and identified the components of a infromation system, and i have a good understanding of how each component plays a part to make up a infromation system. During this course, i look forward to expanding my knowledge on IT and use that knowledge to pursue a  rewarding career in IT.
