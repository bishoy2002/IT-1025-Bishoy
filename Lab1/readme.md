## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the setup for the IT1025 class and learn and get used to using GitHub to do my work in organized repositories. This class will cover a wide variety of topics from components of a infromation system, to cyber security. This course will cover topics that will assist me with my passion of IT. The first step of this lab was being introduced to GitHub and practicing screen capturing. I also read chapter one in the book. During this lab, I was introduced to to the components of a infromation system. The different components are: hardware, software, data, people, and processors. I learned that each component plays a key role in operating an infromation system. I was also introduced to cloud computing and client-server architecture. Cloud computing is storing data on a server rather than on a personal device. Client-server architecture allows users to connect to a LAN by connecting to a central computer called a server.

## Information System Components
Components of infromation systems are the hardware, software, data, people, and processors.  Each component plays a specific role. Hardware is tangible physical items such as mouse, keyboard,disk drives, and flash drives. Software is the set of instuctions that tells the hardware whate to do.  Data is a collection of facts such as address, phone number, and social media profile. People play a role because we need people to program the software. and processors which is a set of steps to achieve a goal such a opening/ closing programs.

## GitHub
GitHub allows users to create new ideas with organized and easy to use repositories.
### Client - Server Architecture
A client server allowed users to log in to the local network or LAN from their device by connecting to a central computer called a server.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the practice of storing data on a client hosted server, rather than on a personal device. Examples of cloud computing are social media platforms. GitHub uses cloud computing by storing data to the server. This repository is an example of clould computing!!!

## Conclusion
During this lab, I learned how to use the GitHub platftform. Although i had trouble making my lab at first, i practiced and now i have a good understanding of how to use GitHub to do my assignments. I read chapter one and identified the components of a infromation system, and i have a good understanding of how each component plays a part to make up a infromation system. During this course, i look forward to expanding my knowledge in IT and use that knowledge to pursue a  rewarding career in IT.
